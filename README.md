# AI-Enabled Car Parking System Using OpenCV  

An innovative project that leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to automate and optimize car parking. This system uses OpenCV for real-time image processing and object detection, aiming to transform traditional parking management by addressing challenges like limited parking spaces, congestion, and inefficient allocation.  

## 📌 Features  

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detects and tracks cars using OpenCV.  
- **Parking Space Monitoring**: Identifies empty parking spaces and optimizes utilization.  
- **Automation**: Reduces the need for human intervention in parking lot management.  
- **Scalability**: Can be adapted to parking lots of various sizes.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and object detection.  
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.  
- **AI and Machine Learning**: To enhance object detection accuracy and optimize parking management.  

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Input**: Captures real-time video streams from parking lot cameras.  
2. **Processing**:  
   - Processes the video using OpenCV for object detection and tracking.  
   - Identifies parked and unoccupied spaces.  
3. **Output**: Provides a visual representation of available parking spaces and guides vehicles to optimal spots.  

## 💡 Use Cases  

- **Commercial Parking Lots**: Efficiently manages large-scale parking spaces.  
- **Smart Cities**: Integrates into smart city infrastructure to reduce congestion.  
- **Residential Complexes**: Provides seamless parking for residents and visitors.  

## 🧰 Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV library  
- Camera feed or pre-recorded video footage for testing  

## 📈 Future Enhancements  

- Integration with IoT sensors for hybrid detection systems.  
- Adding support for license plate recognition.  
- Mobile app for real-time parking updates and reservations.
